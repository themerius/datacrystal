"""``datacrystal[web]`` GraphQL boundary — reflect ``@entity`` into Strawberry (#23 / #49 S6).

The GraphQL half of the web tier: the shared reflection in :mod:`._reflect` is
turned into a Strawberry type here, resolving fields over a pinned
``store.snapshot()`` — never the live engine object. The reflection rules
(which fields, what core type) come straight from the engine's
:class:`~datacrystal._entity.TypeInfo`, so the REST (:mod:`._pydantic`) and
GraphQL surfaces can never disagree on what an entity exposes.

What this story (#99) builds, and where it stops:

* **Scalar fields** (``str``/``int``/``float``/``bool``, and ``list``-of-scalar
  via :func:`datacrystal._entity._is_list_of_scalar`) become GraphQL scalar
  fields with **no resolver** — Strawberry's *default* resolver
  (``StrawberryField.get_result`` → ``default_resolver(source, python_name)``,
  ``types/field.py:234``) does a plain ``getattr`` against the source, which is
  a frozen :class:`~datacrystal._snapshot.EntityView`
  (``EntityView.__getattr__``, ``_snapshot.py:114``). No Pydantic, no copy, no
  live entity crosses the request edge.
* **Entity-reference fields** (``FieldSpec.entity_ref`` / ``lazy_refs``) become
  GraphQL *object* fields whose declared type is the referenced ``@entity``'s
  reflected Strawberry type. Since #100 (S6b) they carry an **async relation
  resolver** (:func:`_relation_resolver`): it reads the raw
  :class:`~datacrystal._snapshot.Ref` token the default resolver would have
  returned and hands the OID to a **per-request DataLoader**, so a query
  following N sibling refs in one resolver tick batches into **one**
  ``Snapshot.get_many`` instead of N+1-ing the store.

The DataLoader (the N+1 killer)
-------------------------------

The relation resolver pulls a :class:`SnapshotLoader` off ``info.context`` (the
key :data:`LOADER_CONTEXT_KEY`) and awaits ``loader.load(oid)``. The loader
is **built per request, not defaulted** (:func:`snapshot_context` /
:meth:`SnapshotLoader.__init__`):

* its ``load_fn`` is :meth:`Snapshot.get_many` over the **one** snapshot pinned
  for that request/operation — the same watermark every field on the request
  reads from (ADR-002 read views);
* it is constructed with ``cache=False``. Strawberry's vendored DataLoader
  defaults to ``cache=True`` (``dataloader.py:139``), a **lifetime** cache that
  would leak resolved entities across requests *and* across snapshot watermarks
  (a stale read after a commit). Request scoping is a property we *build* by
  turning that off and constructing the loader fresh per request — never a
  default we inherit (:func:`test_loader_is_request_scoped_not_lifetime_cached`);
* a tick's ``.load()`` calls coalesce into one batch by Strawberry's
  ``call_soon`` scheduling (``dataloader.py:248``), so the load_fn receives the
  whole sibling-set of OIDs at once;
* a deleted/dangling ``Ref`` rides ``get_many``'s None-on-miss (ADR-003,
  unchecked deletes) — the loader returns ``None`` in that slot and the field
  resolves to GraphQL ``null``, never a 500.

Mutually- and self-referential entities (``Mineral`` ↔ ``Locality``) are built
with the type registry in :class:`StrawberryReflector`: each entity gets one
Strawberry type, cached by typename; a reference field's annotation is patched
in **after** both endpoint types exist (Strawberry resolves field types lazily
at schema-conversion, so the post-build patch is honoured). No hand-written
per-entity schema class — :func:`strawberry.tools.create_type` builds each type
from the reflected field list at runtime.

``strawberry`` is imported **only at this submodule's top** — never from core and
never from :mod:`._reflect` — so plain ``import datacrystal`` stays inside the
``{msgspec, pyroaring}`` budget (fitness gate ``test_import_isolation_*``).
